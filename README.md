        The database consists of 7 tables: employer, applicant, job, country, city, account, and applicantsjobs. The applicantsjobs table was created to 
establish a many-to-many relationship between applicants and jobs. The country and city tables were introduced to store various country and city 
options, while the account table was created to manage common attributes such as username and password for both applicants and employers. A 'type'
column was added to differentiate between these two user types.
